<p align="center">It <font face="gabriola">is a relationship that is easily lazy. This relationship will not make the other party helpless. They discover that while they are discussing different topics, they can be relaxed with each other relaxed. It sounds fairly interesting no matter what the other person says, but you need to be very careful to understand the story. It is almost impossible to achieve some goals together because of the need for understanding. It can be quite difficult to do business or activities together. Because they do not understand each other's motives or reasons for their actions. Whatever the partner is trying to accomplish, it is usually shown to the other as insufficient and meaningless. Because they expect different kinds of activities from each other, they become critical or negative about the intention or purpose of the other. The misunderstandings seen among the viewers are easy to be humorously reflected. An introverted partner always tries to avoid an extrovert partner 's assertion and persuasion. An introverted partner wants to make an extrovert partner in pursuing independence so that an introverted partner can become an 'ordinary person' as they think.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="gabriola">They do not trust each other's capabilities. These discrepancies usually end in short. Because they are attracted to each other. Sometimes this relationship can be a warm and caring relationship. These good relationships are created when working together but when the work is different. They can be inspired by the results of a successfully completed project. But when they try to start a new project again, they will experience the same difficulties in collaborating again.</font><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="palatino linotype"></font></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="palatino linotype"></font></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="palatino linotype"></font></span></p>
